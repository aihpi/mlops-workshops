    "\n",
    "Welcome to the MLOps Series taught by AI Services from the Hasso-Plattner-Institute. We are a publicly funded project supported by the BMBF (Ministry for Education and Research). Visit [our website](https://hpi.de/kisz) to learn more about our offerings and join our [AI Maker Community on Slack](https://join.aimaker.community) to keep track of our weekly workshops and paper readings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the series\n",
    "In this series of workshops we dive into the basics of Docker and try to give an intuitive understanding about how it can be used. As the series progresses, we will demonstrate how Docker can be used for ML projects for local development and for serving models using an API.\n",
